##Browser Developer Tools
Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load. By default, Developer Tools opens with the Elements tab open. The tabs are:

**Elements:** Shows you the HTML used to build the page you’re looking at, together with any inline CSS.

**Console:** Deals with JavaScript. It gives you information about interactive elements on a page. In Console, you can write JavaScript to interact with the web page you’re viewing, and it also lets you write messages to yourself in the JavaScript of websites you’re building, which then show up in Console to show that the JS was executed.

**Sources:** Shows you where all the files that were used to make the website are stored and lets you inspect them.

**Network:** Shows you all the files that are loading in the URL you’re looking at. You will get detailed information on all the items loaded, including the initiator and time it took to load that element.

**Application:** Shows you what’s in your browser storage: in-browser databases like Web SQL, local storage, and more. It also gives you granular control over your cookies.

**Security:** Gives you basic security information, letting you view a site’s HTTPS certificate and TLS status.

**Audits:** Autogenerates reports on site functionality and structure to help developers improve performance.
